        I like using anime profile pictures, it's the easiest to find and don't have to take photos on the phone.

        I joined Robotics when I was in 9th grade our team 8730 got to states but didn't win but we still take pride because we had won in the city in order to get there so the time put into our robot was worth it.
        Now because of COVID we are doing it online. Competitions like CoderZ, Student Virtual Prototyping Design, 3D mascot designing and Seaperch.

        During the third month of quarantine we had a road trip to Indianna. We had safety precautions. I spent a lot of time at Lake Michigan. It was fun!

        I only watched one series of anime called "One Piece". It's funny, full of adventures, and has emotions sometimes.
